    "# Image Processing (and Matplotlib)\n",
    "Image processing is an extremely powerful tool for biomedical engineering. Did you know that in DNA sequencing image processing is used to make judgment calls for each individual base pair being A, T, C, or G? Image processing is also used in a variety of biomedical applications, like diagnosing cancerous tumors in images of tissue, image-guided surgery, and in numerous and disparate research applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this module, we will explore a very simple image processing task: how to differentiate between handwritten 0's and 1's. While on the surface this task seems unrelated to biomedical engineering, a simple leap of imagination reveals that this kind of image processing could be used to differentiate (and thus diagnose) between bacilli and cocci. In other words, by learning how to process images of 0's and 1's, you are also learning how to develop a streptococci test!\n",

    "### Image Data and Format\n",
    "The first thing we need to do in order to begin analyzing handwritten 0's and 1's, is to use Python to load a bunch of sample images of handwritten 0's and 1's. In the following code, we will be importing the two following files:\n",
    "* `zeros.txt` contains 1000 images of 28 pixel x 28 pixel binary images of handwritten 0's\n",
    "* `ones.txt`\n",
    "contains 1000 images of 28 pixel x 28 pixel binary images of handwritten 1's\n",
    "\n",
    "A **binary image** is an image that only has two possible values for each pixel, in this case 0 or 1. For this module, a pixel with value 0 will be white and a pixel with value 1 will be black (this is not always the case for image processing in general).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you open the two text files, you will see that each file contains 1000 rows of 784 (28x28) 0 and 1's separated by spaces. Each of these rows corresponds to one 28x28 handwritten binary image. When we load the rows of 0 and 1's from these text files, we will need to \"reshape\" each row from a 1-dimentional 1x784 vector to a 28x28 sized 2-dimensional image. This is what the `reshape(1000, 28, 28)` function does in the code below.\n",
    "\n",
    "After we have reshaped each image, we will be left with a final 1000x28x28 matrix of 0's and another 1000x28x28 matrix of 1's. This means that when we want to select the i'th image of the 0's, we can do so with the Python statement `zero[i-1, :, :]`. The `i-1` denotes the i'th image (because remember Python is 0-indexed!), and the colons denote that we want all 28 rows and 28 columns of the i'th image.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Matplotlib and Numpy\n",
    "At the beginning of the code, you will see that we will be importing a couple of libraries to use in this module:\n",
    "* `matplotlib` is a powerful Python plotting library that emulates plotting in MATLAB. This package will allow us to \"plot\" or show the imges of handwritten 0's and 1's. \n",
    "* `numpy` is a powerful Python library that allows us to use powerful functions with arrays and matrices\n",

To do this, we can simply sum all 1000 of the binary images together for each of 0 and 1. This in effect overlaying all 1000 images on top of each other and seeing what the aggregate image looks like. Remember that for each individual image, each pixel value can only be 0 or 1; however, if we sum all 1000 images together, each pixel value will range from 0 (if none of the 1000 images were black at that pixel) to 1000 (if all of the 1000 images were black at that pixel). This way, we can get an idea of which pixel locations in the 28x28 image are \"popular\" for the 0's and which ones are popular for the 1's. We will use the function `np.sum()`, which takes a matrix, and sums all the matrix entries along one of the dimensions (also known as axes). Since we have a 1000x28x28 matrix, and we want to sum all the 1000 images, we want to sum along the 1st axis (but remember that Python is 0-indexed, so this is really the 0th axis!). The code for this and the resulting \"heatmap\" images are shown below."

This means that for images with total black pixels in this range, it will be impossible to tell if they are 0's or 1's if we only look at the total number of black pixels. We can kind of tell that around 125 black pixels, there seems to be a decision boundary between the 0's and the 1's. Even so, if we choose 125 black pixels to be our boundary, a quick glance at the histogram tells us that we will incorrectly classify ~50 of the 0's as 1's and >50 of the 1's as 0's. This is around a 5% error rate for the discrimination task, which is a pretty high error rate if you're trying to diagnose if a patient has a bacilli or a cocci infection.

This function returns all the index (pixel) positions of an array or matrix that are **nonzero**, meaning all the pixels that are black! Therefore, to get the width at the middle of a 0 or a 1, we simply need to take the maximum pixel position that is nonzero and subtract the minimum pixel position that is nonzero for all the pixels in the middle row of the 28x28 image (you can choose whether to pick the 14th or the 15th row).
