    "gives us the 4th through 7th character in 'Hello World!'. The index position 3 actually corresponds to the 4th character in 'Hello World!' This is because in Python, strings start at index position 0. Also notice that the code asks for `word[3:7]`. Using the logic that strings start at index position 0, you would think that the index position 7 in `word[3:7]` would correspond to the 8th character in 'Hello World!' and that printing `word[3:7]` would result in 'lo Wo'. However, the \"splicing\" notation used here is inclusive on the first parameter 3 and exclusive on the second parameter 7, which means that `word[3:7]` actually prints out the 4th through 7th character in 'Hello World!' This inclusive/exclusive condition is true for all splicing in Python. Thus, if we wanted the 6th through 8th character in 'Hello World!', we would print `word[5:8]`. Please look up the Python documentation on your own time if you are still confused. Making sure indices are correct in any coding language is half the battle, and is especially important when dealing with genomic data where the exact position of each nucleotide is crucial!\n",

    "1. Observe how when we tried to write our own, \"naive\" algorithm to find a sequence of repeated 'A's in chromosome 21, the computation time is in the order of magnitude of seconds; however, when we use Python's built-in substring search function 'in', the computation time is on the order of hundredths of seconds or faster. This is because manually comparing strings using the == operator at every single index position in chr21 takes a very long time. When using the 'in' keyword, the makers of Python have implemented a very fast string search algorithm called Boyer-Moore that searches for substrings much faster than comparing the substring at every position in a string. This results in the hundredfold reduction in string search time.\n",
    "2. Notice how in general, the longer the sequence we want to search for, the longer the computation time takes. Whether the computation time increases linearly, exponentially, or in some other mathematical relationship as the length of the sequence increases is known as the time-complexity of the string search algorithm. Time-complexity is a fundamental measurement of how efficient an algorithm is, and is very important to keep in mind when designing and implementing algorithms."

What many of you may not know is that there is a second Chargaff's Rule that says that even among a single strand of DNA, the percentage of As is approximately the same as the percentage of Ts, and the percentage of Gs is approximately the same as the percengate of Cs.

    "As succinct as that program is, it still uses a for-loop to iterate over every base in the DNA string. In typical Python fashion, if there already exists a string command that can perform that mapping for us, we should just use that package/implementation if possible, as built-in implementations are generally faster and more scalable. In our case, we might be working with DNA strings with millions of characters, and we want to limit the overhead/computation in Python as much as possible. This will also give you experience of \"googling/stackoverflowing\" documentation. In the next question, try writing the `ReverseComplement` function without any for loops. There are still plenty of ways to tackle this problem, but try using the `maketrans` method in the strings package."
